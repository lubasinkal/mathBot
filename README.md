# MathBot

A simple chatbot that can answer mathematical questions and engage in small talk.

## Running the Application

To run the application, you need to have Go installed. You can download it from [here](https://golang.org/dl/).

Once you have Go installed, you can run the application using the following command:

```bash
go run .
```

This will start a web server on port 8080. You can access the application by opening your web browser and navigating to `http://localhost:8080`.

## How it Works

The application is built using Go and the following libraries:

*   **net/http**: For creating the web server.
*   **govaluate**: For evaluating mathematical expressions.

The frontend is built using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and jQuery.
